Libstats provides a simple way for library reference & service desks to track statistics on the number of questions asked, as well as build a simple knowledge base.

Libstats requires PHP and Pear::DB. It is, by far, easiest to run via Apache.

## There's a new sheriff in town! ##

Well, I wouldn't say sheriff so much as someone that doesn't want to see a project like this fall by the wayside.  We use it where I work and I've offered to "take over" maintaining the code.  Does that mean there'll be a new version out?  Not anytime real soon.  In fact, I hate to admit that I haven't done much of anything with the code as of yet.

So, if you find bugs, have requests, have a question or just feel chatty, post away.  I'll do my best to answer any and all questions as quickly as possible.

I would like to thank Nate (and all the other contributers) for the tremendous amount of work he has done on libstats.  I can't speak for him directly, but I'm willing to bet he's lurking in the shadows listening in should there be any questions that I am unable to answer.

Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding as I come up to speed on all things libstats.

## Nate's farewell ##

Hi all,

After four years of development, I'm leaving my current job and leaving this project an orphan. I'd love for someone else to take up the mantle and make the project great -- or at least keep it from succumbing to bit rot. If you'd like to be maintainer of a small, fairly simple open-source project, head to [our discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/libstats) and get in touch.

Thanks to all who have used libstats and helped to make it better.

Cheers!
-Nate
